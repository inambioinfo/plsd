This website contains a test version for calculation of personalized risk estimate for first cancer. Underlying data and declaration of methods is to be published, and when published link to publication will appear here.

Note that the number of PMS2 carriers included are insufficient for realiable conclusions. Risk estimates for PMS2 carriers should therefore be interpreted with caution.

Due to the low penetrance of MSH6 before 50 years of age, few MSH6 carriers with cancer before 50 years of age were included. Calculated results on next cancer in patients of age less than 50 years should thus not be considered for MSH6 carriers.
